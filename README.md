# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common rendering issue in React Native's FlatList component when using dynamic styles. The problem arises from the FlatList's view recycling mechanism, which can lead to inconsistencies when styles or layouts change frequently.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` file contains a FlatList that renders items with a dynamically calculated height. This dynamic height causes view recycling to behave unpredictably, leading to visual glitches such as incorrect heights or overlapping components.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution by using the `key` prop effectively within the FlatList's renderItem function to ensure the FlatList recognizes each item as unique, even if the data itself hasn't changed. This improves view recycling and eliminates the rendering inconsistencies.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app on an Android or iOS emulator/device.
4. Observe the rendering glitches in the initial version (`bug.js`).
5. Compare with the corrected version (`bugSolution.js`).
